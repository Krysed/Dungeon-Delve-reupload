# "Dungeon Delve" is a game project created in Raylib.


"Dungeon Delve" is a small game created as part of a group project for a software engineering course during my studies. The game involves collecting experience points by defeating enemies. After completing the game, players can check their score on a leaderboard where scores achieved during gameplay are recorded.
